- I only got through the position analysis, so I only have two plots

- We can see point O' moving as we expect, it swings across in a circle of radius 2
- Point Q however 'drifts' substantially from its supposed fixed position at the origin. 
    This is likely due to the accumulation of numerical error. Likely this would become
    less pronounced if we decreased the stepsize, but would likely always be present due
    to instability in our solving process
